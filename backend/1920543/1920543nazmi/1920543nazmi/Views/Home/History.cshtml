        <b>Cappadocia</b> was known as Hatti in the late Bronze Age, and was the homeland of the Hittite power
        centred at
        Hattusa. After the fall of the Hittite Empire, with the decline of the Syro-Cappadocians (Mushki) after
        their
        defeat by the Lydian king Croesus in the 6th century, Cappadocia was ruled by a sort of feudal aristocracy,
        dwelling in strong castles and keeping the peasants in a servile condition, which later made them apt to
        foreign
        slavery. It was included in the third Persian satrapy in the division established by Darius but continued to
        be
        governed by rulers of its own, none apparently supreme over the whole country and all more or less
        tributaries
        of the Great King.

        <h2>Kingdom of Cappadocia</h2>

    <p class="ccc">
        After ending the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great tried to rule the area through one of his military
        commanders. But Ariarathes, a Persian aristocrat, somehow became king of the Cappadocians. As Ariarathes
        I
        (332–322 BC), he was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far
        as to
        the Black Sea. The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander. The previous
        empire
        was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to Eumenes. His claims were made good in 322 BC by
        the
        regent Perdiccas, who crucified Ariarathes; but in the dissensions which brought about Eumenes's death,
        Ariarathes II, the adopted son of Ariarathes I, recovered his inheritance and left it to a line of
        successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty.

        Persian colonists in the Cappadocian kingdom, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper,
        continued
        to practice Zoroastrianism. Strabo, observing them in the first century BC, records (XV.3.15) that these
        "fire kindlers" possessed many "holy places of the Persian Gods", as well as fire temples. Strabo
        furthermore relates, were "noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there
        is a
        large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning." According to Strabo, who wrote
        during the time of Augustus (r. 63 BC–14 AD), almost three hundred years after the fall of the
        Achaemenid
        Persian Empire, there remained only traces of Persians in western Asia Minor; however, he considered
        Cappadocia "almost a living part of Persia".

        Under Ariarathes IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of
        Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon. The kings henceforward threw in their
        lot
        with the Republic as against the Seleucids, to whom they had been from time to time tributary.
        Ariarathes V
        marched with the Roman proconsul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus against Aristonicus, a claimant
        to
        the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated (130 BC). The imbroglio which followed his
        death
        ultimately led to interference by the rising power of Pontus and the intrigues and wars which ended in
        the
        failure of the dynasty.
        <h2>Turkish Cappadocia</h2>
    <p class="ccc">
        Cappadocia is famous for traditional cave hotels.
        Following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, various Turkish clans under the leadership of the Seljuks
        began settling in Anatolia. With the rise of Turkish power in Anatolia, Cappadocia slowly became a
        tributary to the Turkish states that were established to the east and to the west; some of the
        population converted to Islam[citation needed] with the remainder forming the Cappadocian Greek
        population. By the end of the early 12th century, Anatolian Seljuks had established their sole
        dominance over the region. With the decline and the fall of the Konya-based Seljuks in the second
        half of the 13th century, they were gradually replaced by the Karaman-based Beylik of Karaman, who
        themselves were gradually succeeded by the Ottoman Empire over the course of the 15th century.
        Cappadocia remained part of the Ottoman Empire for the centuries to come, and remains now part of
        the modern state of Turkey. A fundamental change occurred in between when a new urban center,
        Nevşehir, was founded in the early 18th century by a grand vizier who was a native of the locality
        (Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha), to serve as regional capital, a role the city continues to assume
        to this day.[19] In the meantime many former Cappadocians had shifted to a Turkish dialect (written
        in Greek alphabet, Karamanlıca), and where the Greek language was maintained (Sille, villages near
        Kayseri, Pharasa town and other nearby villages), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding
        Turkish. This dialect of Greek is known as Cappadocian Greek. Following the 1923 population exchange
        between Greece and Turkey, the language is now only spoken by a handful of the former population's
        descendants in modern Greece.

    <h2>Modern Tourism</h2>
    <p class="ccc">
        <img class="img2 zoom" src="~/Content/img/GoremeOpenAirTheater.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="150">
        The area is a popular tourist destination, as it has many areas with unique geological, historic, and cultural features.

        Touristic Cappadocia includes 4 cities: Nevsehir, Kayseri, Aksaray and Nigde.

        The region is located southwest of the major city Kayseri, which has airline and railway service to Ankara and Istanbul and other cities.

        The most important towns and destinations in Cappadocia are Ürgüp, Göreme, Ihlara Valley, Selime, Guzelyurt, Uçhisar, Avanos and Zelve. Among the most visited underground cities are Derinkuyu, Kaymakli, Gaziemir and Ozkonak. The best historic mansions and cave houses for tourist stays are in Ürgüp, Göreme, Guzelyurt and Uçhisar.

        Hot-air ballooning is very popular in Cappadocia and is available in Göreme. Trekking is enjoyed in Ihlara Valley, Monastery Valley (Guzelyurt), Ürgüp and Göreme.

        Sedimentary rocks formed in lakes and streams and ignimbrite deposits that erupted from ancient volcanoes approximately 9 to 3 million years ago, during the late Miocene to Pliocene epochs, underlie the Cappadocia region. The rocks of Cappadocia near Göreme eroded into hundreds of spectacular pillars and minaret-like forms. People of the villages at the heart of the Cappadocia Region carved out houses, churches and monasteries from the soft rocks of volcanic deposits. Göreme became a monastic centre in 300–1200 AD.

        The first period of settlement in Göreme goes back to the Roman period. The Yusuf Koç, Ortahane, Durmus Kadir and Bezirhane churches in Göreme, and houses and churches carved into rocks in the Uzundere, Bağıldere and Zemi Valleys, all illustrate history and can be seen today. The Göreme Open Air Museum is the most visited site of the monastic communities in Cappadocia (see Churches of Göreme, Turkey) and is one of the most famous sites in central Turkey. The complex contains more than 30 carved-from-rock churches and chapels, some having superb frescoes inside, dating from the 9th century to the 11th century.

        The area was featured in several films due to its topography. The 1983 Italian/French/Turkish film Yor, the Hunter from the Future was filmed in Cappadocia. The region was used for the 1989 science fiction film Slipstream to depict a cult of wind worshippers. In 2010 and early 2011, the film Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was also filmed in the Cappadocia region. Pier Paolo Pasolini's Medea, based on the plot of Euripides' Medea, was filmed in Göreme Open Air Museum's early Christian churches.

        Turkish model and actress Azra Akın took part in a commercial for a chewing gum called First Ice. The commercial shows some of the area's features.

        In Assassin's Creed: Revelations, Cappadocia is an underground city in Turkey which is dominated by Templars. In the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, Cappadocian is an extinct clan of vampires based around Mount Erciyes.

        Cappadocia's winter landscapes and broad panoramas are prominent in the 2014 film Winter Sleep (Turkish: Kış Uykusu), directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes film festival.
