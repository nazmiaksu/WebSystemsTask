            <b>Cappadocia</b> was known as Hatti in the late Bronze Age, and was the homeland of the Hittite power
            centred at
            Hattusa. After the fall of the Hittite Empire, with the decline of the Syro-Cappadocians (Mushki) after
            their
            defeat by the Lydian king Croesus in the 6th century, Cappadocia was ruled by a sort of feudal aristocracy,
            dwelling in strong castles and keeping the peasants in a servile condition, which later made them apt to
            foreign
            slavery. It was included in the third Persian satrapy in the division established by Darius but continued to
            be
            governed by rulers of its own, none apparently supreme over the whole country and all more or less
            tributaries
            of the Great King.

            <h2>Kingdom of Cappadocia</h2>

            <p>After ending the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great tried to rule the area through one of his military
                commanders. But Ariarathes, a Persian aristocrat, somehow became king of the Cappadocians. As Ariarathes
                I
                (332–322 BC), he was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far
                as to
                the Black Sea. The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander. The previous
                empire
                was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to Eumenes. His claims were made good in 322 BC by
                the
                regent Perdiccas, who crucified Ariarathes; but in the dissensions which brought about Eumenes's death,
                Ariarathes II, the adopted son of Ariarathes I, recovered his inheritance and left it to a line of
                successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty.

                Persian colonists in the Cappadocian kingdom, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper,
                continued
                to practice Zoroastrianism. Strabo, observing them in the first century BC, records (XV.3.15) that these
                "fire kindlers" possessed many "holy places of the Persian Gods", as well as fire temples. Strabo
                furthermore relates, were "noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there
                is a
                large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning." According to Strabo, who wrote
                during the time of Augustus (r. 63 BC–14 AD), almost three hundred years after the fall of the
                Achaemenid
                Persian Empire, there remained only traces of Persians in western Asia Minor; however, he considered
                Cappadocia "almost a living part of Persia".

                Under Ariarathes IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of
                Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon. The kings henceforward threw in their
                lot
                with the Republic as against the Seleucids, to whom they had been from time to time tributary.
                Ariarathes V
                marched with the Roman proconsul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus against Aristonicus, a claimant
                to
                the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated (130 BC). The imbroglio which followed his
                death
                ultimately led to interference by the rising power of Pontus and the intrigues and wars which ended in
                the
                failure of the dynasty.
                <h2>Turkish Cappadocia</h2>
                <p>
                    Cappadocia is famous for traditional cave hotels.
                    Following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, various Turkish clans under the leadership of the Seljuks
                    began settling in Anatolia. With the rise of Turkish power in Anatolia, Cappadocia slowly became a
                    tributary to the Turkish states that were established to the east and to the west; some of the
                    population converted to Islam[citation needed] with the remainder forming the Cappadocian Greek
                    population. By the end of the early 12th century, Anatolian Seljuks had established their sole
                    dominance over the region. With the decline and the fall of the Konya-based Seljuks in the second
                    half of the 13th century, they were gradually replaced by the Karaman-based Beylik of Karaman, who
                    themselves were gradually succeeded by the Ottoman Empire over the course of the 15th century.
                    Cappadocia remained part of the Ottoman Empire for the centuries to come, and remains now part of
                    the modern state of Turkey. A fundamental change occurred in between when a new urban center,
                    Nevşehir, was founded in the early 18th century by a grand vizier who was a native of the locality
                    (Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha), to serve as regional capital, a role the city continues to assume
                    to this day.[19] In the meantime many former Cappadocians had shifted to a Turkish dialect (written
                    in Greek alphabet, Karamanlıca), and where the Greek language was maintained (Sille, villages near
                    Kayseri, Pharasa town and other nearby villages), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding
                    Turkish. This dialect of Greek is known as Cappadocian Greek. Following the 1923 population exchange
                    between Greece and Turkey, the language is now only spoken by a handful of the former population's
                    descendants in modern Greece.
